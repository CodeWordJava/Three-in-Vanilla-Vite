# Three-in-Vanilla-Vite

## learning objectives
 - understand how x,y,z axes work in three.js
  - play with materials and light to understnad how each work
   -add animated GLTF to scene and animate within the scene using in built animation rather than axis object manipulation.
   
 ## Learnings
 
 I brought the repo together in Vite with a vanilla JS file due to access issues in serving the assets folder when I have tried in CRA. I didn't want to use RÂ£F for this as I wanted to understand three in long form before I looked at the condensed methods available.
 It appears the location of the assets folder matters as the GLTF files would only load if they were at the root of the project folder.
 The animations inbuilt to the GLTF I chose were fairly easy to access by previewing in a view and picking the number in the animation array that was connected to the animation I wanted.
